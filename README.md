## What is MobyBolt?
MobyBolt is a guide for setting up a Dockerized Bitcoin and Lightning node on a personal computer from scratch, doing everything yourself. You will learn about Linux, Docker, Bitcoin, and Lightning. As a result, you'll have your very own Bitcoin node, built by you and no one else.

Mobybolt is inspired by other guides such as [RaspiBolt](https://raspibolt.org/) and [MiniBolt](https://v2.minibolt.info/), adding Docker containerization to them.
